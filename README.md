# End-to-End Brute-Force Attack Simulation and Monitoring in an AD Environment

**Project Summary:**
This project involves simulating a Brute Force Password Attack in a secure environment using Active Directory (AD)and SIEM (Splunk) tools. The key objective is to demonstrate how a brute force attack is executed, logged, and detected through telemetry. It covers setting up Active Directory with users, configuring a Kali Linux attacker machine, running brute force attack commands, and visualizing the attack using Splunk.

**Key Components**:
1.	**Active Directory Server Setup**: Added users and configurations to simulate a real-world domain environment.
2.	**Kali Linux Machine**: Used as the attacking system to perform brute force password attacks.
3.	**SIEM (Splunk)**: Monitored and visualized telemetry to detect and analyze the brute force attack.

**Learning Points:**
1.	**Active Directory Basics**: Setting up and managing users in an AD environment. Understanding the role of AD in enterprise security.
2.	**Brute Force Attack Execution**: Configuring and using tools in Kali Linux to simulate brute force attacks. Analyzing attack success and vulnerabilities.
3.	**SIEM Monitoring**: Using Splunk to track and visualize security events. Understanding the importance of telemetry in attack detection.
4.	**Security Awareness**: Recognizing the signs of brute force attacks in a real-world scenario. Applying proactive measures to safeguard enterprise systems.
